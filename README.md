Local Musical or Locale Musicale --- which sounds better?


## User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to find live music events in the United States
SO THAT I can learn about visiting and local music artists.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a website to look up live music events in Richmond, VA:
<!-- UPDATE THIS TO BE ABOUT WHAT WE WANT IT TO BE (I'm just keeping these here for now so that we have the format)
1. WHEN I open the planner,
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. WHEN I scroll down,
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
3. WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day,
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. WHEN I click into a timeblock,
    THEN I can enter an event.
5. WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock,
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.
6. WHEN I refresh the page,
    THEN the saved events persist. -->
```
